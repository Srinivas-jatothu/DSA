# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) - LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my DSA repository! Here, I solve LeetCode problems and upload my C++ solutions. The goal of this repository is to practice various algorithms, enhance problem-solving skills, and build a strong foundation in data structures.

## Repository Structure

- Each folder represents a LeetCode problem.
- Inside each folder, you'll find:
  - `Problem_Name.cpp`: The C++ solution to the problem.
  - A `README.md` with a brief explanation of the problem and the approach I used to solve it.

## Problem of the Day

I solve a new LeetCode problem each day and commit my solution here. This repository serves as a daily learning journal, tracking my progress and growth in problem-solving.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Srinivas-jatothu/DSA.git
