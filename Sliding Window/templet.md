# Sliding Window Algorithm Pseudocode (C++ Template)

## Steps:
1. **Initialize pointers**: Set two pointers `i` and `j` to represent the start and end of the sliding window.
2. **Initialize variables**: Set up variables to keep track of the current window state (e.g., sum, count, frequency).
3. **Use a `while` loop** to iterate through the array using the `j` pointer:
   - Update the current window state based on the element at index `j`.
   - **While the current window is invalid** (e.g., exceeds a limit or doesn't satisfy a condition):
     - Update the current window state based on the element at index `i`.
     - Increment the `i` pointer to shrink the window from the left.
   - **Update the result** based on the current window state.
4. **Return the result** after processing the array.

## C++ Pseudocode Template:

```cpp
// Sliding Window Function Template
int slidingWindow(const vector<int>& arr, int condition) {
    int i = 0;  // Left pointer of the window
    int result = 0;  // Variable to store the result
    int windowState = 0;  // Initialize the window state (e.g., sum, count)

    // Use a while loop for the right pointer 'j'
    int j = 0;
    while (j < arr.size()) {
        // Update the window state with arr[j]
        windowState += arr[j];
        
        // While the window is invalid (condition not met)
        while (windowState > condition) {  // Example condition
            // Shrink the window by removing arr[i] from the state
            windowState -= arr[i];
            i++;  // Increment the left pointer to shrink the window
        }
        
        // Update the result based on the current window
        result = max(result, windowState);
        
        // Expand the window by incrementing j
        j++;
    }

    return result;
}
